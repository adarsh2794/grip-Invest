Aim

1.Create a store for grip invest with all clients and there assets information
	As an example, imagine that you and 5 of your friends (admin here) were to co-invest in bikes of Yamaha(actual owner) that were then leased to a restaurant (clients here) to use for delivery and pay all of you a monthly rental.

2.For simplification assets can be either be a bike,car or bus of some owners such as (VOLVO,SKODA,YAMAHA)

3.Clients can be added in real-time using the client addition page

3.CRM dashboard is there with chip search feature (Where nested queries can be made for Asset Type and Owner Company to get the relevant clients)

4.The search fetches data directly from MySQL database at realtime


Note: This is a simple project protoype with limited functionalities



Tech Stack Used

1.MySql -Database

2.React for Building Commponents

3.Node Express Js for Backedn API

4.JS for front end search

5.CSS



Scope of Improvements

1.To extend the search to multiple parameters

2.To include the functionality of monthly rental gained by the admin from clients to which they have leased the asset to.

3.To include functionality of monthly expense the admin bears on paying to actual owner (YAHAMA)

4.Profit earned by admin on this transaction via Grip Invest

5.Dashboards

P.S: As mentioned in the assignment every one is inclined towards either backend or front end but its the passion to learn new things and adapt. 
So is the case with me as i have been mostly inclined towards backend.
Havent used some of the tech stack mentioned here before this,hence a great learning experience
Thanks


Please call for any other clarifications
